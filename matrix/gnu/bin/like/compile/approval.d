/*
 D is a general-purpose systems programming language with a 
 C-like syntax that compiles to native code. It is statically 
 typed and supports both automatic (garbage collected) and 
 manual memory management. D programs are structured as 
 modules that can be compiled separately and linked with 
 external libraries to create native libraries or executables.

 This document is the reference manual for the D Programming 
 Language. For more information and other documents, see The 
 D Language Website.
