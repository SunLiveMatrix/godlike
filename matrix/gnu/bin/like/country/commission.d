/**
Phases of Compilation

The process of compiling is divided into multiple phases. Each phase is independent of subsequent phases. For example, the scanner is not affected by the semantic analyzer. This separation of passes makes language tools like syntax-directed editors relatively easy to create.

    source character set
    The source file is checked to determine its encoding and the appropriate scanner is loaded. 7-bit ASCII and UTF encodings are accepted.
    script line
    If the first line starts with "#!", then that line is ignored.
    lexical analysis
    The source file is divided into a sequence of tokens. Special tokens are replaced with other tokens. SpecialTokenSequences are processed and removed.
    syntax analysis
    The sequence of tokens is parsed to form syntax trees.
    semantic analysis
    The syntax trees are traversed to declare variables, load symbol tables, assign types, and determine the meaning of the program.
    optimization
    Optimization is an optional pass that attempts to rewrite the program in a semantically equivalent, more performant, version.
    code generation
    Instructions are selected from the target architecture to implement the semantics of the program. The typical result will be an object file suitable for input to a linker.
